<h2>Project - UG:</h2>
<h2><b>Title</b>:Virtual Reality Based Disaster Management </h2>

<p>Description: Virtual Reality is seen as the high-end of human-computer interactions and it has the<br>
    potential to target a wide range of applications. To improve the standardization and automation of<br>
    disaster operation management, a new method of emergency management based on the activity<br>
    network technology is presented. Firstly, the emergency plan is built upon emergency response<br>
    activities by using the activity network technology. While a virtual trajectory may be represented using,<br>
    straight lines connecting way points of interest, this simple model does not accurately represent typical<br>
    user behavior. We implemented the model within a framework that can be used for redirect food<br>
    distribution within different virtual and physical environments. It is useful for the evaluation of<br>
    redirection of parameters under varying conditions. The characteristics of each operation mode are<br>
    analyzed, which provides an important reference for the researchers of the operation and management<br>
    of the process food supply chain.
