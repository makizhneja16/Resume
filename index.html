<h2><b>Title</b>:Virtual Reality Based Disaster Management </h2>

<p>Description: Virtual Reality is seen as the high-end of human-computer interactions and it has the
    potential to target a wide range of applications. To improve the standardization and automation of
    disaster operation management, a new method of emergency management based on the activity
    network technology is presented. Firstly, the emergency plan is built upon emergency response
    activities by using the activity network technology. While a virtual trajectory may be represented using,
    straight lines connecting way points of interest, this simple model does not accurately represent typical
    user behavior. We implemented the model within a framework that can be used for redirect food
    distribution within different virtual and physical environments. It is useful for the evaluation of
    redirection of parameters under varying conditions. The characteristics of each operation mode are
    analyzed, which provides an important reference for the researchers of the operation and management
    of the process food supply chain.
